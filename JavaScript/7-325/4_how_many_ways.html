    <script src="./first.js"></script>

    <!-- 3. 3rd way (it will be laod both the files at a time simultaneously but html will be loaded before the script is being downloaded, but after the script is downloaded,html content is innediately parsed ) -->
    <script src="./first.js" async></script>


    <!-- 4.4th way,  script is being downloaded while the html is being parsed,unlike async it waits until the entire html is parsed before executing -->
    <script src="./first.js" defer></script>
